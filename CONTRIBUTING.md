# Contributing to Entanglement Tabletop Gravity (ETG)

Thank you for your interest in the ETG project! We are building an open-source bridge between Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, and we need your help.

## 🤝 How You Can Help

We are currently in the **Pre-Launch Validation** phase and are looking for:

*   **Beta Testers:** Run the simulation on different machines/OS and report issues.
*   **Quantum Mathematicians:** Help us refine the theoretical models and explore scaling to Tensor Networks.
*   **Python Developers:** Optimize the `etg_engine.py` for larger qubit counts or improve the 3D visualization in `etg_visualizer.py`.
*   **Educators:** Feedback on how to make these concepts more accessible for students.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a **Pull Request**.
